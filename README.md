## ðŸ¤– HealthBot for Everyone
Design to help hospitals that are understaffed or patients that can't get immediate healthcare


HealBot is a Healthcare Domain Chatbot to simulate the predictions of a General Physician with the help of a trained machine model. 

The HealthBot is an AI-powered diagnostic assistant designed to simulate consultations with a general physician. Built for the healthcare domain, this chatbot leverages machine learning to provide symptom analysis and medical guidance, bridging the gap between patients and healthcare providers through intelligent automation.

### :page_with_curl: Overview  
Chatbots are AI-driven interfaces capable of human-like conversations through text or voice. This project focuses on **diagnostics**, using natural language processing (NLP) and decision tree algorithms to deliver accurate, user-friendly health assessments.  

In an era where telehealth is critical, this chatbot serves as a 24/7 virtual assistant, helping users identify potential health issues, reducing misinformation, and streamlining access to care. Hospitals and clinics can deploy it to triage patients, schedule appointments, and provide preliminary diagnoses, enhancing operational efficiency.
